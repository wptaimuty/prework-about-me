      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 3D modeler. I am looking to make a career change to coding/programming. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>... I was born in Louisiana and have lived everywhere from Texas to Alaska to California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>3D modeling personal projects, working on my sci-fy/fantasy novel, creating short historical documentaries, and typical geek stuff (D&D, video games, movies, etc.)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>... No idea. If I knew, I wouldn't be taking a coding bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm back in Texas (Austin specifically).</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My career prospects as a 3D modeler seem rather poor (chaotic, cuthroat, unstable, high stress, etc.). Coding seems to provide more stability and security (and I still get to create things).</p>
